# High Performance Computing with R


## Description

By some measures, R is the most popular software package for the analysis of
data. But R has a reputation for being sluggish and inappropriate for large
datasets. However, much of R's problems with performance and scalability are
due to bad practices of individual programmers rather than being inherent
limitations of R itself.

In this half-day (four hour) tutorial, we will introduce participants to
debugging, profiling and performance analysis, optimization, foreign language
API's, and parallel programming with R. There will also be a comprehensive
hands-on component to reinforce topics introduced during the lecture portion.

Slides and exercises will be posted to this repository some time
before the tutorial begins.



## Who Should Attend

The tutorial is ideally suited for those already working with R, as well as
service providers who are serving R customers. The content is appropriate for
any students, researchers, or staff who are working with R and interested in
performance. 



## Location and Registration

The tutorial will be held February 27, 2015, 1â€“5 p.m. EST.  It will be 
presented remotely as well as locally for University of Tennessee folks.
